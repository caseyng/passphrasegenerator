PassphraseGenerator is a lightweight and easy-to-use tool for generating strong passphrases. Whether you need a secure password for your accounts or a memorable phrase for authentication, this tool allows you to customize your passphrases with various options like word count, delimiters, and case formatting.

##Why This Is Useful
In an era of growing cybersecurity threats, it's crucial to use strong, unique passwords. Way too many people use the same passwords over and over, with only minor changes, if any.

PassphraseGenerator helps you generate strong passphrases that are easier to remember than random strings of characters, yet still provide a high level of security. By using a combination of words, delimiters (such as spaces, digits, or symbols), and case formatting, you can create passphrases that strike the right balance between security and memorability.

##Key Features:
- Customizable word count: Choose between 2 to 8 words for your passphrase.
- Delimiters: Add digits, spaces, or symbols to further secure your passphrase.
- Pascal or Lower case: Generate passphrases in Pascal case (capitalized) or all lowercase.
- Quick Profile: Select from predefined passphrase types (e.g., password or passphrase) to speed up the process.

##How It Works
- Select the number of words: Choose how many words you want in your passphrase (2–8 words).
- Choose case format: Select between Pascal case (capitalized first letter of each word) or lowercase.
- Pick your delimiters: You can include digits, spaces, and symbols in your passphrase.
- Generate: Click the "Go!" button, and the tool will generate your customized passphrase.

The passphrase will be displayed immediately, ready for you to use.

##No Dependencies
One of the best features of PassphraseGenerator is that it has no external dependencies. It’s built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This means you can run it offline in any modern web browser without needing to install anything or deal with additional libraries. Just open the file and start generating passphrases instantly!
